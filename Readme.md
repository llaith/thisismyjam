This is My Jam
===

A site to tell the world what you're listening to.

Uses Scala's Play 2.1.x with MongoDB using Reactive Mongo and the Reactive Mongo Play plugin, client-side rendering done using Play templates and AngularJS.

Searches artist/track info using the last.fm api and sends it off to a MongoDB database.

##Live version
A live version of the site is running at:

[http://thisismyjam.herokuapp.com/](http://thisismyjam.herokuapp.com/)

Keep in mind that it may take a long time to load, this is because the free tier of Heroku hosting lets the server sleep and it takes a long time to wake it up again.
